# Devshare - Your beloved snippet sharing platform

Devshare is a dedicated online code snippet sharing platform designed to make sharing and managing code snippets easy and efficient.

## What is a snippet?
Well, a snippet is a small piece of code that you can share with your friends or colleagues.
Mostly, they are meant to be helpful pieces of code that you might come back to later on.


## Why Devshare?
Currently, there are websites like [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) but are not specifically tailored for snippets. They are more general-purpose, allowing the sharing of a wide range of content, from plain text to full readme files. This can make it challenging to find high-quality, practical code snippets for your collection.

Devshare aims to solve this problem by focusing on snippets only. Here are some reasons why you should use Devshare:
- _Dedicated Snippet Focus_: Devshare is designed for sharing code snippets, ensuring you'll find exactly what you're looking for.
- _User-Friendly Terminal_: Access a sleek terminal interface with the shortcut `CMD + K` for seamless website navigation, snippet management, basic arithmetic operations, terminal commands (e.g., date, time, clear), and easy snippet searching.
- _Enhanced User Interface_: Devshare offers a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface for sharing, managing, and discovering code snippets.

Not only do you get to share snippets but we make it more fun and giving you a great user interface
